# Week 2

## Goals - (Taken from Makers Curriculum)

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback


## My Responses to Goals
### Use all of week 1's skills

I certainly continued to use all the skills learnt in week one and found that I was reinforcing what I'd learnt. Significantly more tasks came to me automatically.

### Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage

I split a class into two new classes in the Oystercard weekly challenge. The exercise meant that we constructed a class for an 'Oystercard', which referenced a 'journey'. Once the class and its assoicated methods and tests were significantly developed, we had to split the class by separating any reference to a journey into a new 'Journey' class. The process I followed with my pair partners was to incramentally change methods and variables from the Oystercard class to the Journey class. Each time a change was made, we would follow the errors given by our tests to ensure that the programme and the tests were both working. This allowed us to not get overwhelmed and lost as we were altering our programme.
We didn't complete the exercise this week and finished on the Friday evening when we were part-way through splitting the class. I learnt a lot about class interaction and how to determine when to create a new class. This really helped with the take-away challenge.

### Unit test classes in isolation using mocking

I found that I understood the principles of unit testing in isolation - using stubs and doubles - but found the syntax challenging to implement at times. I practiced using them in the workshops and weekly exercises, but I feel that of all the topics this week, this was the one I was least comfortable with. I need to write more tests to understand their use better.

### Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)

I presume that the 'ease of change' refers to how easy it is to change code significantly when everything is packaged into interacting objects. I can see that OOP makes changin a lot easier than if you had one long script. It's easier to navigate and picture how the different objects interact because they have realatable names. Having different objects with their own suite of tests makes it easier to track down error messages as well.

### Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

I did this in the code review session on Monday, where I commented on the weekend Airport challenge of one of my cohort. Their code was very good and looked similar to mine. I was able to offer comments to refactor a couple of the methods. I found reading someone elses code very helpful and took some tips away for myself.
